this tests the use of sander for postprocessing 
a trajectory file. each frame is read and minimization
is carried out. Note that the trajectory file is an 
INPUT file in this case.

In addition, the targeted MD option is employed to 
calculate and report the RMSD from the reference 
structure for each of the trajectory frames.

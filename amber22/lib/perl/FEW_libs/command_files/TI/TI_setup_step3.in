# Parameters required for TI analysis:
#
# ti_ddG: Request calculation of difference in binding free energy.
# charge_method: Charge method that shall be used, either "resp" or "am1"
# lig_name_v0_struct: Name of start-ligand - Must be identical to the name of
#                     the file in the "structs" folder used for generation of
#                     parameter and library files with the common MD setup
#                     functionality of FEW.
# lig_name_v1_struct: Name of end-ligand - Must be identical to the name of
#                     the file in the "structs" folder used for generation of
#                     parameter and library files with the common MD setup
#                     functionality of FEW.
# lig_alias_v0: Alias that shall be used for the identification of the
#               start-ligand. The alias must consist of 3 characters.
# lig_alias_v1: Alias that shall be used for the identification of the
#               end-ligand. The alias must consist of 3 characters.
# dVdL_calc_source: Specification of files considered in computation of ddG:
#                   0: All files available for ligand and complex are considered
#                   X-Y: Where X is the number of the first and Y is the number
#                   of the last production file that shall be taken into account.
#                   If Y=0 all files from X on will be considered.
# ddG_calc_method: Method to be used for the calculation of dG:
#                  1: Conventional numerical integration with interpolation
#                     to lambda=0 and lambda=1.
#                  2: Numerical integration without interpolation

Welcome to antechamber: molecular input file processor.

Warning: The assigned bond types may be wrong, please :
(1) double check the structure (the connectivity) and/or 
(2) adjust atom valence penalty parameters in APS.DAT, and/or 
(3) increase PSCUTOFF in define.h and recompile bondtype.c
    (be cautious, using a large value of PSCUTOFF (>100) will 
    significantly increase the computation time).

##   See definitions in the script that created this file for details.
##   Using a 6-linked DGlcpb 
##
# set 1
  m0 = sequence { TBT 6GB MEX }
  set m0.2.C6 charge +0.243
  charge m0

# set 2
  m1 = sequence { TBT 6GB ACX }
  set m1.2.C6 charge +0.290
  charge m1

# set 3
  m2 = sequence { TBT 6GB SO3 }
  set m2.2.O6 charge -0.427
  charge m2

## Testing residues made for linking to proteins.
##
##   Testing RES-ALA-RES-ALA-RES to ensure that we have tried a decent
##       set of linkage environments.

## Built 3 molecules
##	Now, translate them away from each other

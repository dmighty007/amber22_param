PyRESP Test Cases:

Four test cases are provided which cover a range of posibilities. Run the following script in each subfolder for testing.

$ ./py_resp.run

1. water
- Models: resp, resp-ind, resp-perm and resp-perm-v.
- Test: One-stage fitting on a single conformation.

2. ethylene
- Models: resp, resp-ind, resp-perm and resp-perm-v.
- Test: One stage fitting on a single conformation. No total charge constraint applied.

3. peptoid
- Models: resp, resp-ind and resp-perm.
- Test: Two stage fitting on a single conformation. Intra-molecular fractional charge constraint applied.
- Note: A peptide-type residue with consistent constraints with Cornell et al. '95 force fields.

4. bis-naphthyl
- Models: resp, resp-ind and resp-perm.
- Test: Two stage fitting on a two conformations. Inter-molecular fractional charge constraint applied.
- Note: Two 2-Methyl-3-naphthylpropionic acid molecules fitted together to obtain charges for the "super molecule" bis-(naphthyl-1-methyl) acetic acid.

# Parameters required for TI analysis:
#
# ti_ddG: Request calculation of difference in binding free energy.
# charge_method: Charge method that shall be used, either "resp" or "am1"
# lig_name_v0_struct: Name of start-ligand - Must be identical to the name of
#                     the file in the "structs" folder used for generation of
#                     parameter and library files with the common MD setup
#                     functionality of FEW.
# lig_name_v1_struct: Name of end-ligand - Must be identical to the name of

This is a test of the multisander thermodynamic integration:

Run.0 and Run.1 do a short md with ordinary prmtop files, set up for regular
    toluene, and toluene with zero charges

Run.lambda0 and Run.lambda1 do the same, icfe set, using multisander

Hence, the results for Run.0 should match Run.lambda0, and those for Run.1
    should match Run.lambda1, except for the DV/DL terms being computed.

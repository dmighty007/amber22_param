This test case is to show that the charge view energy is consistent
with the FDPB energy for the full nonlinear PB equation. The
consistency can be very high when the finite-difference green's function
is used up to 40x40x40 grid spacing separations in the charge view
pairwise summations. Also the consistency is only possible with the bcopt=1,
i.e. the conductor BC because the other BC's are only approximated. Note
PBC doesn't work for nonlinear PB yet.

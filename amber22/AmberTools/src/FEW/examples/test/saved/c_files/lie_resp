# General Parameters for LIE calculation setup
#
# lie_calc: Request setup of LIE calculations
# charge_method: Charge method used for MD, either "resp" or "am1"
# no_of_rec_residues: Number of residues in receptor structure
# additional_library: If an additional library file is required, e.g. for
#                     non-standard residues present in the receptor structure,
#                     this file must be specified here.
# additional_frcmod: If additional parameters are needed, e.g. for describing
#                    non-standard residues present in the receptor structure,
#                    a parameter file should be provided here.
# lie_executable: Location of LIE calculation script provided with FEW.
#                 If no script is specified, it is assumed that the LIE
#                 program is located in the default directory.
# lie_batch_template: Template batch file for LIE calculation 
# lie_batch_path: Path to regard as basis path for setup of batch files

# Parameters for coordinate extraction
#
# image_trajectories: If set to "1" solutes of the specified trajectories
#                     will be imaged to the origin before coordinates are
#                     extracted. Please regard that this may require a large
#                     amount of additional disc space.
# image_mass_origin: The receptor structure will be imaged with respect to
#                    the mass origin if 'image_mass_origin=1'. Default=0.
# trajectory_files: Trajectory files to regard. The path will be determined
#                   automatically. Specify 'all' to regard all trajectories
#                   produced in the production phase of the MD simulations.
#                   This ensures consistent snapshot numbering.
#                   Subsets of snapshots will be generated according to the
#                   parameters first_lie_snapshot, last_lie_snapshot, and
#                   offset_lie_snapshots. If only a subset of the trajectories
#                   from MD shall be used, the individual files must be 
#                   specified as 'trajectory_file   <file_name>' providing one 
#                   entry per line.
#                   ATTENTION: The trajectory file(s) must exist for both the
#                              simulation of the complex and the simulation of
#                              the free ligand in solution.
# snaps_per_trajectory: Number of snapshots stored in each trajectory.

#

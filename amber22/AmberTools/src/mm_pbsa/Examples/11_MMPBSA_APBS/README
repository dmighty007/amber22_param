# The energies in this example were calculated with a sander.APBS version implemented

# Polar free energy of solvation (PBCAL)
The PBCAL energies calculated with the parameters provided in the example differ by
~1% from those that are determined by PBSA.
To reproduce the polar solvation energies of the APBS calculation as close as
possible add BCOPT, SMOOTHOPT, and DPROB to the &pb namelist prepared in 
$AMERHOME/src/mm_pbsa/mm_pbsa_createinput.pm for the PBSA calculation
and set BCOPT=6, SMOOTHOPT=2, and DPROB=1.5 in mm_pbsa.in

# Nonpolar free energy of solvation (PBSUR)
If a pure APBS calculation is conducted (PB == 1, MS == 0, and PROC == 3)
the nonpolar solvation energy is calculated with the parameters set for sander.APBS.
In this case SURFTEN and SURFOFF are not considered and the surface tension can be
specified via the parameter GAMMA. Please consider that this value needs to be given
in kJ / mol A^2. 
E.g. if the nonpolar solvation free energy shall be calculated with PARSE radii specific 
parameters (SURFTEN: 0.00542 kcal / mol A^2; SURFOFF: 0.92 kcal / mol), GAMMA needs to be 
set to 0.0227 kJ / mol A^2 and 0.92 kcal / mol have to be added manually to the calculated
nonpolar energy.

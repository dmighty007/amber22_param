#sample residuegen input file
#INPUT_FILE: 	   	Structure file in ac format, generated from a Gaussian output with 'antechamber'
#               	(Cmd: antechamber -fi gout -fo ac -i input.gout -o output.ac)
INPUT_FILE      	ala.ac

#CONF_NUM:      	Number of conformations applied
CONF_NUM        	2

#ESP_FILE:      	ESP file generated from gaussian output with 'espgen'
#               	(cmd: espgen -i input.gout -o output.esp)
#               	if multiple conformations applied, catenate all the CONF_NUM esp files into ESP_FILE
#               	(cmd: cat output1.esp output2.esp output3.esp ... > output.esp)
ESP_FILE        	ala.esp

#ATOM_TYPE_SET		this parameter specifies atom type to be used, check supported atom type using 
#			'antechamber -h'. The default value is "default", i.e. using the default atom type in
#			INPUT_FILE			
ATOM_TYPE_SET		amber

#SEP_BOND:      	Bonds that separate residue and caps, input in a format of (Atom_Name1 Atom_Name2 TYPE),
#              	 	where Atom_Name1 belongs to the residue and Atom_Name2 belongs to the cap. 
#              	 	When TYPE is 1,  ATOM_NAME1, the HEAD_ATOM, is connected to the immediate proceding residue 
#              	 	(such as C of an amino acid); 
#              	 	when TYPE is -1, ATOM_NAME1, the TAIL_ATOM, is connected to the immediate succeeding residue 
#              	 	(such as C of an amino acid)
#              	 	When TYPE is 0, it is just used to trunctat unwanted atoms (such as extra side chain atoms). 
#              	 	SEP_BOND may show up 
#			several times or not show up at all.
SEP_BOND        	N1 C2	1  N C
SEP_BOND        	C5 N2	-1 C N
#			Alternatively, one can use HEAD_ATOM, TAIL_ATOM and SEP_BOND (type = 0) to define head/tail 
#			atoms and atoms to be omitted, for example
#HEAD_ATOM		N1 n c
#TAIL_ATOM		C5 o n
#			N1 is the head atom, its atom type is n and it is bonded to an atom with atom type of c
#			C5 is the tail atom, its atom type is o and it is bonded to an atom with atom type of n

#NET_CHARGE:    	Net charge of the residue, such as 0 of ALA and -1 of ASP and 1 of LYS
#               	this option is ignored when the number of SEP_BOND lines is zero
NET_CHARGE      	0

#ATOM_CHARGE:   	Predefined atom charge, input in a format of (Atom_Name Partial_Charge)
#               	can show up multiple times.
ATOM_CHARGE     	N1 -0.4175
ATOM_CHARGE     	H4 0.2719
ATOM_CHARGE     	C5 0.5973
ATOM_CHARGE     	O2 -0.5679

#PREP_FILE:     	Prep file name
PREP_FILE:      	ala.prep

#RESIDUE_FILE_NAME:     Residue file name in PREP_FILE
RESIDUE_FILE_NAME:      ala.res

#RESIDUE_SYMBOL:        Residue symbol in PREP_FILE
RESIDUE_SYMBOL:         ALA

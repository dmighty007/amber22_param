The fav8_2x1x1.{rst7,pdb} files have the original CSD coordinates
The fav8_2x1x1c.{rst7,pdb} files used cpptraj to center the molecule at the
         center of the box
The fav8_2x1x1o.{rst7,pdb} files used cpptraj to center the molecule at the
         origin of the box

If you modify Run.fav8 to cycle the pdb,rst7 files among these choices,
keeping everything else the same, you get three different results.

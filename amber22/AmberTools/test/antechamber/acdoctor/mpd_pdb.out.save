/tmp/amber/bin/acdoctor: Fatal Error!
This molecule may have more than one unit.
       antechamber can only handle one unit.  If the input is a single unit
       then the connectivity is wrong and the geometry may be bad.
       Please convert your molecule to a mol2 file via:
       antechamber -j 5 -at sybyl -dr no 
       And then check your molecule with a visualization program;
       manually add missing bonds or delete unwanted bonds as appropriate.

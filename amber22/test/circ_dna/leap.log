   set default variable value
      STRING                     _variable_
      STRING                     _value_
OR
    set container parameter object
      UNIT/RESIDUE/ATOM/STRING   _container_ 
      STRING                     _parameter_
      object                     _object/value_

This command sets the values of some global parameters (when the first
argument is "default") or sets various parameters associated with _container_.
The possible variables for "set default" are:
  PdbWriteCharges  "on"         add charges to each ATOM record 
                   "off"        don't do this (default)
  OldPrmtopFormat  "on"         use prmtop format from Amber6 and earlier
                   "off"        use the new prmtop format (default)
  GBParm           "bondi"      use Bondi radii for generalized Born (default)
                   "mbondi"     use modified Bondi radii 
                                   (see Users' Manual for details)
  Dielectric       "distance"   use distance-dependent dielectric (default)
                   "constant"   use constant dielectric

The more useful parameters for each type of _container_ are:
  container    attributes           values

  UNIT         name                 STRING
               head, tail           ATOM [e.g. unit.1.1]
               restype              "protein" "nucleic" "saccharide" "solvent"
                                    "undefined" [sets all residues in UNIT]
               cap                  LIST [center, radius: {X Y Z  R}]
                                    or "null"

  RESIDUE      name                 STRING
  [e.g.        restype              [see UNIT]
   unit.1]     connect0, connect1   ATOM [e.g. unit.1.1]
               imagingAtom          ATOM [e.g. unit.1.1]

  ATOM         name, pertName       STRING [<= 4 chars]
  [e.g.        type, pertType       STRING [<= 2 chars]
   unit.1.1]   element              STRING
               pert                 "true" [or pert flag unset]
               charge, pertCharge   DOUBLE

This folder contains example command files with the minimum no. of flags / parameters
that should be specified / considered.

It is assumed that ligand input structures are provided as single structure mol2 files
and that the receptor contains only residues defined in the ff12SB force field.

For simulation setup the template files provided under
$AMBERHOME/AmberTools/src/FEW/examples/input_info will be used.
In case of TI simulation setup, it is assumed that SHAKE can be applied. 

ATTENTION: The example command files for setup of MD simulations contain the key phrase
           for the MMPBSA or MMGBSA procedure in the first line. Please change this
           key phrase in case you want to setup MD simulations according to the LIE or
           TI workflow.

If any problems are encountered in the setup procedure it should be checked,
whether additional parameters might need to be defined for the the specific system.
Example command files for the individual setup steps of the different procedues
containing all available parameters can be found in the procedure specific folders
under $AMBERHOME/AmberTools/src/FEW/examples/command_files.

#
#   mm_pbsa allows to calculate (absolute) free energies for one molecular
#   species or a free energy difference according to:
#
#   Receptor + Ligand = Complex,
#   DeltaG = G(Complex) - G(Receptor) - G(Ligand).
#
#   VERBOSE - If set to 1, input and output files are not removed. 
#             This is useful for debugging purposes.
#   PARALLEL - If set to values > 1, energy calculations for snapshots are done
#              in parallel, using PARALLEL number of threads. 
#
#   PREFIX - To the prefix, "{_com, _rec, _lig}.crd.Number" is added during
#            generation of snapshots as well as during mm_pbsa calculations.

#           (optional, defaults to 1).

#          (optional, defaults to 10e10).
#   OFFSET - Specifies the offset between snapshots in energy calculations 
#            (optional, defaults to 1).
#
#   COMPLEX - Set to 1 if free energy difference is calculated.
#   RECEPTOR - Set to 1 if either (absolute) free energy or free energy
#              difference are calculated.

@DECOMP
#
# Energy decomposition parameters (this section is only relevant if DC = 1 above)
#
#   Energy decomposition is performed for gasphase energies, desolvation free
#     energies calculated with GB, and nonpolar contributions to desolvation
#     using the ICOSA method.
#   For amino acids, decomposition is also performed with respect to backbone
#     and sidechain atoms.
#
#   DCTYPE - Values of 1 or 2 yield a decomposition on a per-residue basis,
#            values of 3 or 4 yield a decomposition on a pairwise per-residue
#               basis. For the latter, so far the number of pairs must not
#               exceed the number of residues in the molecule considered.
#            Values 1 or 3 add 1-4 interactions to bond contributions.
#            Values 2 or 4 add 1-4 interactions to either electrostatic or vdW
#              contributions.
#
#   COMREC - Residues belonging to the receptor molecule IN THE COMPLEX.
#   COMLIG - Residues belonging to the ligand molecule IN THE COMPLEX.
#   RECRES - Residues in the receptor molecule.
#   LIGRES - Residues in the ligand molecule.
#   {COM,REC,LIG}PRI - Residues considered for output.
#   {REC,LIG}MAP - Residues in the complex which are equivalent to the residues
#                  in the receptor molecule or the ligand molecule.

@PB
#
# PB parameters (this section is only relevant if PB = 1 above)
#
#   The following parameters are passed to the PB solver.
#   Additional input parameters may also be added here. See the sander PB
#   documentation for more options.
#
#   PROC -  Determines which method is used for solving the PB equation:
#           By default, PROC = 2, the pbsa program of the AMBER suite is used.
#   REFE -  Determines which reference state is taken for PB calc:
#           By default, REFE = 0, reaction field energy is calculated with
#           EXDI/INDI. Here, INDI must agree with DIELC from MM part.
#   INDI -  Dielectric constant for the solute.
#   EXDI -  Dielectric constant for the surrounding solvent.
#   ISTRNG - Ionic strength (in mM) for the Poisson-Boltzmann solvent.
#   PRBRAD - Solvent probe radius in Angstrom:
#           1.4: with the radii in the prmtop files. Default.
#           1.6: with the radii optimized by Tan and Luo (In preparation).
#           See RADIOPT on how to choose a cavity radii set.
#   RADIOPT - Option to set up radii for PB calc:
#           0: uses the radii from the prmtop file. Default.
#           1: uses the radii optimized by Tan and Luo (In preparation)
#           with respect to the reaction field energies computed
#           in the TIP3P explicit solvents. Note that optimized radii
#           are based on AMBER atom types (upper case) and charges.
#           Radii from the prmtop files are used if the atom types
#           are defined by antechamber (lower case).
#   SCALE - Lattice spacing in no. of grids per Angstrom.
#   LINIT - No. of iterations with linear PB equation.
#   IVCAP - If set to 1, a solvent sphere (specified by CUTCAP,XCAP,YCAP,
#           and ZCAP) is excised from a box of water. If set to 5, a solvent shell
#           is excised, specified by CUTCAP (the thickness of the shell in A).
#           The electrostatic part
#           of the solvation free energy is estimated from a linear response
#           approximation using the explicit water plus a reaction field
#           contribution from outside the sphere (i.e., a hybrid solvation approach
#           is pursued). In addition, the nonpolar
#           contribution is estimated from a sum of (attractive) dispersion
#           interactions calc. between the solute and the solvent molecules
#           plus a (repulsive) cavity contribution. For the latter,
#           the surface calculation must be done with MS = 1 and the PROBE should
#           be set to 1.4 to get the solvent excluded surface.
#   CUTCAP - Radius of the water sphere or thickness of the water shell.
#           Note that the sphere must enclose the whole solute.
#   XCAP  - Location of the center of the water sphere.
#   YCAP
#   ZCAP
#
# NP Parameters for nonpolar solvation energies if MS = 0
#
#   INP - Option for modeling nonpolar solvation free energy.
#         See sander PB documentation for more information on the
#         implementations by Tan and Luo (In preparation).
#         1: uses the solvent-accessible-surface area to correlate total
#         nonpolar solvation free energy:
#         Gnp = SURFTEN * SASA + SURFOFF. Default.
#         2: uses the solvent-accessible-surface area to correlate the
#         repulsive (cavity) term only, and uses a surface-integration
#         approach to compute the attractive (dispersion) term:
#           Gnp = Gdisp + Gcavity
#               = Gdisp + SURFTEN * SASA + SURFOFF.
#         When this option is used, RADIOPT has to be set to 1,
#         i.e. the radii set optimized by Tan and Luo to mimic Gnp
#         in TIP3P explicit solvents. Otherwise, there is no guarantee
#         that Gnp matches that in explicit solvents.
#   SURFTEN/SURFOFF - Values used to compute the nonpolar solvation free 
#         energy Gnp acccording to INP.
#         If INP = 1 and RADIOPT = 0 (default, see above),
#         use SURFTEN/SURFOFF parameters that fit with the radii from the
#         prmtop file, e.g., use SURFTEN: 0.00542; SURFOFF: 0.92 for PARSE radii.
#         If INP = 2 and RADIOPT = 1, these two lines can be removed, 
#         i.e. use the default values set in pbsa for this nonpolar solvation 
#         model. Otherwise, please set these to the following: 
#         SURFTEN: 0.04356; OFFSET: -1.008
#
# NP Parameters for nonpolar solvation energies if MS = 1
#
#   SURFTEN/SURFOFF - Values used to compute the nonpolar contribution Gnp to
#   the desolvation according to either
#   (I) Gnp = SURFTEN * SASA + SURFOFF (if IVCAP = 0) or
#   (II) Gnp = Gdisp + Gcavity = Gdisp + SURFTEN * SESA + SURFOFF (if IVCAP > 0).
#   In the case of (I), use parameters that fit with the radii from the
#   reaction field calculation. E.g., use SURFTEN: 0.00542, SURFOFF: 0.92
#   for PARSE radii or use SURFTEN: 0.005, SURFOFF: 0.86 for Tan & Luo radii.
#   In the case of (II), use SURFTEN: 0.069; SURFOFF: 0.00 for calculating the
#   Gcavity contribution.

#
#   The following parameters are used for entropy calculation using

#
#   PROC -  Determines which method is used for the calculations:

#           for electrostatic energies. No entropy decomposition is possible,
#           however. If PROC = 2, the "original" nmode implementation is used.
#           Here, only a distance-dependent dielectric is avaliable for

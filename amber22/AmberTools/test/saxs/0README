The guv* files are 3D  distribution functions  of solvent sites (in this case Ow
and  Hw) around  the solute  test.pdb  computed from  3D-RISM. These files  were
provided  to simplify the test. One can get  those files, however, by  executing
the following commands:

##### build prmtop file
cat <<EOF > leap.in
source leaprc.ff12SB
x = loadpdb test.pdb
saveamberparm x prmtop inpcrd
quit
EOF

$AMBERHOME/AmberTools/bin/tleap -f leap.in

##### run 3D-RISM 
$AMBERHOME/AmberTools/bin/rism3d.snglpnt --pdb test.pdb --prmtop prmtop \
                    --xvv ../rism1d/spc-kh/spc.xvv.save --guv guv --grdspc 1,1,1

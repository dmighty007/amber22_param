Step1: run antechamber to generate gcrt file for Gaussian 09

Welcome to antechamber 21.1: molecular input file processor.

Info: acdoctor mode is on: check and diagnose problems in the input file.
Info: The atom type is set to gaff; the options available to the -at flag are
      gaff, gaff2, amber, bcc, and sybyl.

-- Check Format for mol2 File --
   Status: pass
Info: Ignoring Mol2 record type (@<TRIPOS>SUBSTRUCTURE).
Info: Finished reading file (C3H7I.mol2); atoms read (11), bonds read (10).
Info: Determining atomic numbers from atomic symbols which are case sensitive.
-- Check Unusual Elements --
   Status: pass
-- Check Open Valences --
   Status: pass
-- Check Geometry --
      for those bonded   
      for those not bonded   
   Status: pass
-- Check Weird Bonds --
   Status: pass
-- Check Number of Units --
   Status: pass
acdoctor mode has completed checking the input file.


Step2: run g09 to get g09.gesp - skipped for the actual test
       (one can modify the gesp file name using -ge flag in Step 1)
Step3: run antechamber to assign resp charges

Test case created by Ross Walker in order to provide a PBC test case to go with the release of AMBERTools 1.3. Otherwise we have nothing that tests periodic boundaries which is what almost ALL users are going to be using. Please note I have merely setup this test case and run it. I have not extensively evaluated it against the CHARMM output so its main use right now is purely to test that other machines are getting the same results as mine.

This test case is DHFR with CMAP in a box of water.
